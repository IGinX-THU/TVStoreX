# Quick Start

This short guide will walk you through the basic process of using TVStore.

## Prerequisites

To use TVstore, you need to have:

1. Java >= 1.8 (1.8, 11, and 13 are verified. Please make sure the environment path has been set)
2. Maven >= 3.1 (If you want to compile and install TVstore from source code)
3. Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid "too many open files" problem.

## Build from source

You can download the source code from:

```
git clone https://github.com/thulab/TVStore
```

Under the root path of TVStore:

```
> mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Then the binary version (including both server and client) can be found at **distribution/target/apache-iotdb-{project.version}-incubating-bin.zip**

> NOTE: Directories "service-rpc/target/generated-sources/thrift" and "server/target/generated-sources/antlr3" need to be added to sources roots to avoid compilation errors in IDE.

### Configurations

configuration files are under "conf" folder

  * environment config module (`iotdb-env.bat`, `iotdb-env.sh`),
  * system config module (`tsfile-format.properties`, `iotdb-engine.properties`)
  * log config module (`logback.xml`).

compress_thread_num=1

# How many thread will be set up to perform compress chunk sub-tasks, 4 by default.
# Set to 1 when less than or equal to 0.That is, the number of concurrent series within a single storage group
compress_chunk_subthread_num=4

# compress_ttl in ms, if timestamp of data is within compress_ttl, then the data won't be compressed.
# when compress_ttl is less than or equal to 0, then compress_ttl is valid, all data can be compressed.

```


## Start

You can go through the following step to test the installation, if there is no error after execution, the installation is completed.

### Start TVStore

Users can start IoTDB by the start-server script under the sbin folder.

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/start-server.sh

# Windows
> sbin\start-server.bat
```


### Use TVStore

#### Use Cli

TVStore offers different ways to interact with server, here we introduce basic steps of using Cli tool to insrert and query data.

After installing TVstore, there is a default user 'root', its default password is also 'root'. Users can use this
default user to login Cli to use TVStore. The startup script of Cli is the start-client script in the folder sbin. When executing the script, user should assign
IP, PORT, USER_NAME and PASSWORD. The default parameters are "-h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw -root".

Here is the command for starting the Cli:

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/start-client.sh -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root

# Windows
> sbin\start-client.bat -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

The command line client is interactive so if everything is ready you should see the welcome logo and statements:

```
 _____       _________  ______   ______
|_   _|     |  _   _  ||_   _ `.|_   _ \
  | |   .--.|_/ | | \_|  | | `. \ | |_) |
  | | / .'`\ \  | |      | |  | | |  __'.
 _| |_| \__. | _| |_    _| |_.' /_| |__) |
|_____|'.__.' |_____|  |______.'|_______/  version x.x.x


IoTDB> login successfully
IoTDB>
```

### Stop TVStore

The server can be stopped with ctrl-C or the following script:

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/stop-server.sh

# Windows
> sbin\stop-server.bat
```

## Only build server

Under the root path of incubator-iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -pl server -am -DskipTests
```

After build, the IoTDB server will be at the folder "server/target/iotdb-server-{project.version}".


## Only build client

Under the root path of incubator-iotdb:

```
> mvn clean package -pl client -am -DskipTests
```

After build, the IoTDB client will be at the folder "client/target/iotdb-client-{project.version}".
